## Project Overview
The Humanoids Lab and the Quality of Life Technologies group and Carnegie Mellon formed a project whose goal was to create an inherently safe robot that was able to do useful work.

This work was presented at the EBMC 2011 conference with the paper, Physical Human Interaction for an Inflatable Manipulator

It also turned out to be the inspiration for Baymax of Big Hero 6!
