## Project Overview
[Mobot](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/mobot/) is an annual activity at CMU. 
As a freshman, I wanted to enter into the competition, so joined forces with some savvy electronics and software folks to put together a car. I put the chassis of the beast together and did all the integration with wheels, sensors and compute.
We didn't do too well, but it was a fun start to robot building in Robotics Club!

## Team Members
* Jitu Das
* Harrison Rose


## Project Goal
* develop a robot using parts literally off the shelf (megashelf!)
* use sensors that span forks in the line
