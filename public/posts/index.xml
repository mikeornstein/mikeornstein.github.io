      <description>Project Overview Mobot is an annual activity at CMU. As a freshman, I wanted to enter into the competition, so joined forces with some savvy electronics and software folks to put together a car. I put the chassis of the beast together and did all the integration with wheels, sensors and compute. We didn&amp;rsquo;t do too well, but it was a fun start to robot building in Robotics Club!</description>
