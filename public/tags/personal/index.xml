      <description>Death to GoDaddy GoDaddy sent me a Web Hosting Deluxe Renewal reminder (very courteous of them). It was for $839.40/5yrs. I decided that was too much for a pretty much useless site. I considered downgrading to the &amp;ldquo;Standard&amp;rdquo; hosting plan for $5/mo but couldn&amp;rsquo;t justify it. The nice thing was that the old site had been up a while and I got somewhat used to the wordpress content management scheme. But its time as passed, over 12 or 13 years since the first post on that site.</description>
