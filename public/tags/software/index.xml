&lt;p&gt;Ever had a bunch of random objects that you just couldn’t figure out how to arrange in a pleasing way? Or perhaps you wanted to create something that looked like organized chaos but didn’t want to spend hours manually placing each object in just the right spot? Enter &lt;strong&gt;Thing Arranger&lt;/strong&gt;, a Python tool that arranges objects in aesthetically interesting ways, generating 3D models ready for printing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;death-to-godaddy&#34;&gt;Death to GoDaddy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GoDaddy sent me a Web Hosting Deluxe Renewal reminder (very courteous of them). It was for &lt;strong&gt;$839.40&lt;/strong&gt;/5yrs. I decided that was too much for a pretty much useless site. I considered downgrading to the &amp;ldquo;Standard&amp;rdquo; hosting plan for $5/mo but couldn&amp;rsquo;t justify it. The nice thing was that the old site had been up a while and I got somewhat used to the wordpress content management scheme. But its time as passed, over 12 or 13 years since the first post on that site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
