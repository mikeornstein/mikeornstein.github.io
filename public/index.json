[{"content":"This post mostly brought you by AI\nThing Arranger: A Tool for Aesthetic Object Placement and 3D Printing Ever had a bunch of random objects that you just couldn’t figure out how to arrange in a pleasing way? Or perhaps you wanted to create something that looked like organized chaos but didn’t want to spend hours manually placing each object in just the right spot? Enter Thing Arranger, a Python tool that arranges objects in aesthetically interesting ways, generating 3D models ready for printing.\nDemo Time Made in approximately 22 iterations with GPTEngineer\u0026hellip; no code, just prompt. aesthetic-arranger Still some issues to work out, but overall blown away by how well this worked.\nHow It is Supposed to Work Thing Arranger takes a collection of objects—defined by their 2D footprint and height—and arranges them based on specific rules. The output? A file format ready for 3D printing, like a Parasolid or STL file.\nHere’s a breakdown of the key steps:\n1. Footprint Arrangement First, Thing Arranger tackles the layout of the objects from a top-down perspective, placing each object\u0026rsquo;s footprint. It starts with the largest object to anchor the arrangement.\nFrom there, the objects are placed from largest to smallest, hugging the first object as closely as possible. There’s a buffer you can define—how much space each object should leave around it—ensuring they don’t collide and giving some control over the final layout. If you want everything centered, the first object can start in the middle. Prefer things off to one side? No problem. Set an envelope boundary, and the tool will start positioning objects along an edge like a well-behaved interior decorator.\n2. TODO: Height Setting Once the objects are arranged in 2D space, Thing Arranger tackles their vertical positioning. Instead of placing objects at arbitrary heights, the tool allows you to define a \u0026ldquo;finished height\u0026rdquo; for the top of each object. Here\u0026rsquo;s where it gets interesting: the further an object is from the starting one, the lower its height. This creates a gradual slope effect, with everything cascading down from that first anchor object. You get this neat, organized flow where all objects seem to descend from a focal point.\n3. TODO: Pedestal Creation But what’s a set of beautifully placed objects without some support? Thing Arranger doesn’t just drop your objects onto a flat plane. It builds pedestals for each object, connecting them all together. Think of it as creating an intricate display stand that becomes part of the design itself. The pedestals are generated based on the object positions and heights, ensuring they are not just floating in space but supported by a solid, printable structure.\nOnce all this is done, you can export your finished arrangement as a 3D model, ready to be printed and admired.\nWhy Use Thing Arranger? If you’re into 3D printing or design, Thing Arranger could save you tons of time when it comes to creating organized, visually appealing arrangements. Whether you’re working with sculptures, trinkets, or even abstract shapes, this tool takes away the guesswork of arranging things manually and offers a unique way to create cohesive designs.\nThe best part? It’s customizable. Want a tight cluster of objects centered on a pedestal? Done. Looking for a sprawling design where the objects gently slope down towards the edges? Thing Arranger has you covered.\nIt’s the ultimate utility for anyone looking to turn chaos into something worth printing.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/thing-arranger/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis post mostly brought you by AI\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"thing-arranger-a-tool-for-aesthetic-object-placement-and-3d-printing\"\u003eThing Arranger: A Tool for Aesthetic Object Placement and 3D Printing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver had a bunch of random objects that you just couldn’t figure out how to arrange in a pleasing way?

It was for $839.40/5yrs. I decided that was too much for a pretty much useless site. I considered downgrading to the \u0026ldquo;Standard\u0026rdquo; hosting plan for $5/mo but couldn\u0026rsquo;t justify it. The nice thing was that the old site had been up a while and I got somewhat used to the wordpress content management scheme. But its time as passed, over 12 or 13 years since the first post on that site.\nI was willing to explore some free1 replacement options as I\u0026rsquo;ve come to learn how to use computers a bit better over the years, and I feel like I can get pretty dangerous with new things pretty quickly thanks to the LLMs.\nNow What? As is my go-to for everything these days, I sought wisdom from ChatGPT. It provided me 8 recommendations to my poorly worded and conceived prompt:\nWhat are options for free, modern, professional website options for hosting project portfolios? I have used things like google sites and currently pay for Wordpress hosting but am looking to understand the other options that exist today. There are several options available for creating and hosting modern, professional-looking project portfolios for free. Here are some popular ones:\nGitHub Pages:\nDescription: Ideal for developers, GitHub Pages allows you to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository. You can use Jekyll, a static site generator, to create a professional-looking portfolio. Pros: Free, supports custom domains, integrated with GitHub for version control. Cons: Requires some technical knowledge to set up. \u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;\nEach of these options has its own strengths and is suited to different levels of technical skill and customization needs. Consider what features are most important to you, such as ease of use, design flexibility, or the ability to use a custom domain, when choosing the best platform for your project portfolio.\nSo of course I picked the first one.\nWhere We At So, here we are. The site is now hosted as a github page on a public repo. We\u0026rsquo;ve made it - and this post proves it. This was a little bit of a journey - went something like this:\nAsk ChatGPT for detailed options for GitHub Pages; take the first option Explore Jekyll Realize Jekyll doesn\u0026rsquo;t really do pictures very well Decide to opt for Hugo as a new thing; option #2 from ChatGPT Follow quick start guide and use yucky theme Switch over to PaperMod\u0026hellip; much better. Start porting over wordpress content. Realize I don\u0026rsquo;t actually know what I want the site to be It turns out that my needs are not the same as when I was in college Generate some \u0026ldquo;design criteria\u0026rdquo; for what the site should be. \u0026hellip; Profit? This marks a fresh start for us here, and I’m eager to gradually tidy up the chaos of the internet. The new site will move away from documenting engineering and school-era photo projects, focusing instead on my current side projects and interests. As my passions and resources evolve, so will the content of the site.\nNext Steps I intend to use this platform to chronicle both the mundane and noteworthy side projects and fascinations of the moment. Perhaps I’ll throw in a book review or two, or simply share the latest magic ChatGPT has done at my request… time will tell!\nI\u0026rsquo;m still willing to pay for my domain name\u0026hellip; GoDaddy has been solid there and fair at ~$22/yr\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/first/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"death-to-godaddy\"\u003eDeath to GoDaddy\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoDaddy sent me a Web Hosting Deluxe Renewal reminder (very courteous of them).
